Example
Import the math library.
Take the radius of a circle as user input.
Then, compute the area of the circle using the math library.

The equation for area of a circle is pi * radius * radius

Exercise
Lets make some magic happen with the statistics library.
'''
 # for median, mode, average

# With Statistics Library

# middle value in odd numbered list
odd_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 9, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7]


# average of two middle values
even_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 9, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7]

'''
Exercise
Lets make some magic happen with the pandas library. But before we do that, let's use the OS library to make sure everything generates in our current directory
'''


# __file__ is a built-in constant containing the pathname of the file from which the running Python module was loaded. 

# os.path.abspath to return the directory name of the path which we have provided as the argument of the function.

# os.chdir changes the current working directory to a specific path

# dictionary with my users
users = {
  "acct_num": ['abb', 'cde', 'ggh', 'sdf'],
  "name": ['jim', 'sarah', 'tanya', 'bob']
}


# load into a dataframe


# generate a csv in our current working directory
