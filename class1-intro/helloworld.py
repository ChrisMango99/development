'''Git Hub is the workspace we will be using for this class. 


Here are some of the most important commands for git hub.

git add . - (First Command we type in the console)
git commit -m (We write a message of the commit, ex. inital push)
git push (command we type after the message)
git pull (pull from the github repository)

That's pretty much all there is to github. Think of it like google drive.
